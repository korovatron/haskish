Test cases for String = [Char] implementation:

1. Basic string creation:
   "hello"
   Expected: "hello" (displayed as string, internally ['h','e','l','l','o'])

2. String operations:
   head "hello"
   Expected: 'h'
   
   tail "hello"
   Expected: "ello"
   
   "hello" ++ " world"
   Expected: "hello world"
   
3. Cons operator:
   'h' : "ello"
   Expected: "hello"
   
4. Map over string:
   map (\c -> c) "hello"
   Expected: "hello" (not changed)
   
5. Filter on string:
   filter (\c -> c /= 'l') "hello"
   Expected: "heo"
   
6. List comprehension:
   [c | c <- "hello"]
   Expected: "hello"
   
7. Pattern matching:
   (x:xs) pattern on "hello"
   x should be 'h', xs should be "ello"

8. Comparison:
   "hello" == ['h','e','l','l','o']
   Expected: True (they're the same now!)
