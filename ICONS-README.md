# PWA Icons Required

You need to create these icon files:

1. **icon-192.png** - 192x192 pixels
2. **icon-512.png** - 512x512 pixels

## Recommended Icon Design:
- Use the lambda symbol (λ) or "~λ" to match your logo
- Background color: #7c3aed (purple) or #1e1e1e (dark)
- Should be simple and recognizable at small sizes

## Quick Creation Options:
1. Use an online tool like https://realfavicongenerator.net/
2. Design in Canva, Figma, or any graphics tool
3. Save as PNG with transparency (or solid background)

Both icons should be the same design, just different sizes.
